# EV-Data-Project
Modeling of Electric Vehicle Ownership Data in Washington State

This project is for Gonzaga Universities CPSC 222- Introduction to Data Science course. In this project Jake Snitily and Luke Sahlin are modeling electriv vehicle data in Washington State, with the intent to predict future data.

Technical Report:
  
Your Notebook should have, at a minimum, the following sections (in the order given below):
  Introduction: Briefly describe the project domain, the dataset, your hypotheses, and the classification task you implemented. More specifically:
    Why is the domain important to you and why you are researching in this domain
    What is the dataset format (e.g. CSV files, JSON files, a mix of the two, etc.)
    What tables (emphasis on the plural here) are included in the dataset
      How is the data in each table collected
      How many instances are there in each table
    Include a brief description of the attributes
    What are you trying to classify in the dataset
    What are potential impacts of the results
    Who are stakeholders interested in your results

Data Analysis: Provide details about the dataset, data preparation, exploratory data analysis, and statistical analysis. More specifically:
What cleaning of the dataset did you need to perform (e.g.. are there missing values and how did you handle the missing values)
How are you merging the tables
What are challenges with data preparation
What data aggregation techniques are you applying
What visualizations informatively present the attributes and relationships
What statistical hypothesis tests are you computing
Make sure you set your null and alternative hypotheses up correctly. Please come see me if you have questions about how to do this

Classification Results: Describe the classification approach you developed and its performance. More specifically:
What attribute are you using as class information (i.e., what attribute or attributes are you predicting)
What is the distribution of the class labels? (e.g. 50% yes, 50% no; or 70% weekday, 30% weekend, etc.)
What are your hypotheses about the predictions
How are you evaluating performance of your kNN and decision tree classifier? How do their results compare?
What are challenges with classification

Conclusion: Provide a brief conclusion of your project, including:
A short summary of the dataset you used
The classification approach you developed, your classifiers’ performance, and any ideas you have on ways to improve performance. 
Describe the potential impacts of your work (including ethical impacts) for the stakeholder’s you described in the introduction.
